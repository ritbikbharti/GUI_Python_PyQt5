# GUI_Python_PyQt5
This repository contains my first GUI python application.

## Description:-

The application takes a csv file as input and
processes it to produce aggregated data. The input
file consists of two fields name and cgpa of
students. The application uses pandas module to
read the csv file and *extract aggregated data* like
**max CGPA, min CGPA, mean CGPA, standard
deviation** etc. Based on these data the user can
decide the threshold CGPA. The user then inputs the
company name and min required CGPA. The
application then sorts the data and saves the
required list of eligible students as a csv file with the
name of file as name of the company.

Finally I moulded the code for this application into
GUI where it takes filename as input, load the file
and processes it. And after taking required inputs
from user and processing it, saves the final output
file. The GUI comes as a handy feature for the user
as a graphical interface always pleasures the user.
